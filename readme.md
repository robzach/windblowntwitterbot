# windblowntwitterbot

This simple Twitter bot polls a local weather station's API, finds out the speed and heading of the wind, and then creates an image which blows some multicolored balls around as if they were affected by the wind. (Example: wind is 5.3 mph from 190ยบ. The balls will be blown towards 10ยบ, a moderate amount.) It runs only when I open my computer and wake it up to do some tweeting,but see examples at twitter.com/2prongnoground .
